Simple NaiveBayesClassifier for PHP
-----------------------------------

This project is somewhat a fork of a Ruby implementation of Naive Bayes Classifier <https://github.com/alexandru/stuff-classifier>. There is a blog posts <http://bionicspirit.com/blog/2012/02/09/howto-build-naive-bayes-classifier.html> finely written and simple in its algorithm which I'm sure just about anyone can implement in any programming language.

The project is implemented in PHP in its simplest form. Fork it and play with the codes.

The codes will probably NOT scale with large data sets with a few notes below: 
* MySQL reads will be faster when working with fewer data sets.
* HandlerSocket reads will be faster with larger data sets.
* HandlerSocket writes is not Tested.
* HandlerSocket is using php-handlersocket extension <http://code.google.com/p/php-handlersocket/>
* MongoDB is using php extension from PECL <http://pecl.php.net/package/mongo>
* MongoDB handle inserts very fast
* MongoDB is suited for large datasets
* Redis rocks! Blew all other databases to pieces in benchmarks!
* Redis using php-redis extension <https://github.com/nicolasff/phpredis>


How To Use/Test
---------------

Run the index.php file on command line, any arguments passed after the index.php file will be treated as keywords.

Performance
-----------

I am testing using a late 2011 Macbook Air with 4 GB DDR3 Memory and 128 GB SSD with the following dataset:
* 672,710 Trained keywords
* 1,229 Trained sets
* 16 Blacklisted keywords

Testing results [23 September 2012]:
* MySQL 5.5.24: 1004.3 seconds to classify pizza
* HandlerSocket: Untested due to compilation failures, will test when I get this working
* MongoDB 2.2: 441.4 seconds to classify pizza
* Redis 2.4.15: 1.2 seconds to classify pizza
