Simple NaiveBayesClassifier for PHP
-----------------------------------

This project is somewhat a fork of a Ruby implementation of Naive Bayes Classifier <https://github.com/alexandru/stuff-classifier>. There is a blog posts <http://bionicspirit.com/blog/2012/02/09/howto-build-naive-bayes-classifier.html> finely written and simple in its algorithm which I'm sure just about anyone can implement in any programming language.

The project is implemented in PHP in its simplest form. Fork it and play with the codes.

The codes will probably NOT scale with large data sets with a few notes below: 
* MySQL reads will be faster when working with fewer data sets.
* HandlerSocket reads will be faster with larger data sets.
* HandlerSocket writes is not Tested.
* HandlerSocket is using php-handlersocket extension <http://code.google.com/p/php-handlersocket/>
* MongoDB handle inserts very fast
* MongoDB is suited for large datasets
